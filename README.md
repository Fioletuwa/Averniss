- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Averniss
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML & CSS concepts and working on a basic Portfolio site project. My next goal is learning some JS so i can move on in more advanced features and projects :)

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: do not hesitate to ask me for my Twitter if you have any questions or you want to collaborate with me! I'm open to any collab as long as I can learn from it and meet some inspiring people :)
